Cold Call is a platform to help connect students who want to learn and students who can teach. Despite the interconnectedness of our academic lives nowadays through social medias like LinkedIn, it's still difficult to find exactly the people you're looking for when learning specific skills or subject areas. We're here to fix that problem, starting at Duke. 

We're building Cold Call as a web application where students can sign up for by entering their skillsets, knowledge area, academic interetsts, etc. We then helping to connect those who want to learn certain things to those who can teach them. Hopefully, we'll be able to connect students by getting them to meet at a mutual time and area, or even over a meal or coffee. 

As for our current progress in constructing this application, we've outlined our database structure in our ER diagram (/backend/database/ER.pdf) and created our create.sql file too, which contains our database tables, restrictions, and more (/backend/database/create.sql).

First, we'll just some example data as a proof of concept. Then, to populate our database initially for further testing, we'll be scraping data off of LinkedIn as it is likely the most fitful place to find students, their academic interests, career focuses, skills, and more. However, in the future, we'll create a sign up option where users can create their profiles and enter in data themselves.

THINGS TO WRITE ABOUT:
- A list of assumptions that you are making about the data being modeled.
- A list of database tables with keys declared.
- A description of the Web interface. You can write a brief English description of
how users interact with the interface (e.g., “the user selects a car model from a pull-down menu, clicks on the ‘go’ button, and a new page will display all cars of this model that are available for sale”). Or, instead, you can submit a canned demo version of the website.
